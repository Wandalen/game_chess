            To save the application stability the repository uses a system for forwarding changes from an unstable branch to a stable.
            The unstable branch is `alpha`. All user pull requests should be opened to this branch.
            The staging branch is `beta`. Changes to this branch are forwarded by a pull request from branch `alpha` automatically.
            The stable branch is `master`. Changes to this branch are forwarded by a pull request from branch `beta` automatically. Forwarded changes merge manually after review.

            The pull request was automatically converted to draft. Please, change base branch taking into account the described system `alpha -> beta -> master`.
